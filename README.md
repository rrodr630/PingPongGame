# PingPongGame-in-C-
This is a simple version of the game ping pong in which two users can play against each others. The players are represented by two paddles
the controlls for the paddle on the left are 'w' and 's' to go up and down respectively, and "up arrow" and "down arrow" for the paddle on
the right.

The game is contained in a simple game loop where the "state" of the game is first drawn and then the program checks for any user input
and apply a logic of the current state before refreshing the screen.

It is a very simple game, but it shows some familiarity with the C++ language.
